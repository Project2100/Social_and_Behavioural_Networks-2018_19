# Social and Behavioural Networks - Lecture notes

## About

These are lecture notes about "Social and Behavioural Networks" course, taught by Professor Flavio Chierichetti, for the Master degree in Computer Science at "La Sapienza" University of Rome.

The topics are presented largely in the same order as in the lessons of A.Y. 19/20; however its inception goes back a year earlier, thus some additional content discussed only in A.Y. 18/19 may be present.

Many thanks go to Giovanni Ficarra and Donato Crisostomi, who kept the document alive in 19/20.
